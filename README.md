## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker (for containerized development)
- Redis (for caching, optional for development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ziggo-movie-app.git
   cd ziggo-movie-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create .env files from examples
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

4. Get an API key from [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) and add it to `backend/.env`

### Running Locally

#### Development mode

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

#### Production mode

1. Build both applications:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build

   cd ../backend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the applications:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start

   # In another terminal
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

### Docker Development

Run the entire application stack with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the frontend, backend, and Redis services. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running with Kubernetes Locally

1. Start Minikube:
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

2. Deploy the application:
   ```bash
   # From the project root
   ./scripts/k8s-local-setup.sh
   ```

3. Access the application at the URL provided by the script

## Testing

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests

```bash
# From project root
npm run e2e
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

1. On pull requests:
   - Runs linting and unit tests
   - Verifies build process

2. On merge to main:
   - Runs all tests including e2e
   - Builds Docker images
   - Deploys application via Vercel and Railway

## Deployment

The application is set up for deployment using Vercel (frontend) and Railway (backend):

1. Configure deployment credentials as GitHub secrets:
   - For Vercel (frontend): `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
   - For Railway (backend): `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
   - API keys: `OMDB_API_KEY`

2. Push to the main branch to trigger deployment

## Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture

- **Custom Hooks**: Extracted complex logic into reusable hooks
- **Memoization**: Optimized rendering with React.memo and custom memoization utilities
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing for better developer experience and fewer bugs
- **Component Structure**: Followed atomic design principles for component organization

### Backend Architecture

- **Layered Architecture**: Separated controllers, services, and data access
- **Middleware**: Added validation to ensure data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Implemented consistent error handling patterns
- **Caching**: Added Redis caching to optimize API calls and improve performance

### Performance Optimizations

- **SSR/SSG**: Leveraged Next.js server-side rendering for SEO and initial load performance
- **Image Optimization**: Used Next.js Image component with responsive sizing
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for smaller bundles
- **Memoization**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders

## Trade-offs and Considerations

- **Local Storage for Favorites**: Used localStorage for simplicity. In a production environment, we would implement user authentication and store favorites in a database.
- **Environment Setup**: Development environment uses local Redis. Production would use managed Redis service.
- **API Caching Strategy**: Implemented different TTLs for search (10 min) vs details (24 hours) based on data volatility.

## Scalability and Maintainability

While this application serves as a functional demonstration, several considerations would be important for a production environment:

**Scalability:**

*   **Load Balancing:** Deploying multiple instances of both the frontend (Next.js server) and backend (Node.js API) behind load balancers would distribute traffic and improve availability.
*   **Backend Service Scaling:** The backend Node.js API could be scaled horizontally (more instances). If specific endpoints become bottlenecks (e.g., search), those could potentially be extracted into separate microservices with independent scaling.
*   **Database:** If user data (authentication, persistent favorites) were added, choosing a scalable database (e.g., PostgreSQL with read replicas, MongoDB) and optimizing queries would be crucial.
*   **Caching:** Implementing a distributed cache like Redis (as suggested in bonus points) instead of the current in-memory cache would significantly improve performance under load and allow cache sharing between multiple backend instances.
*   **CDN:** Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static frontend assets (JS, CSS, images served by Next.js) would reduce load on the origin server and speed up delivery to users globally.

**Maintainability:**

*   **Code Conventions & Linting:** Strictly enforcing code style (ESLint, Prettier) ensures consistency across the codebase, making it easier for developers to read and understand.
*   **Testing:** Expanding test coverage, particularly integration tests between frontend and backend services, and potentially adding more E2E flows, would catch regressions earlier.
*   **Documentation:** Maintaining comprehensive documentation (README, code comments, potentially API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI for the backend) is vital for onboarding new developers and understanding system behavior.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly updating dependencies and using tools like `npm audit` or Dependabot helps mitigate security vulnerabilities and keeps the tech stack current.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Implementing robust logging (already started with Winston) and integrating monitoring/alerting tools (e.g., Datadog, Sentry, Prometheus/Grafana) would be essential for tracking application health, performance, and errors in production.
*   **Configuration Management:** Centralizing configuration (beyond basic `.env`) using appropriate tools or services improves consistency.
